# IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION_Codesoft
**Project Overview:**

Briefly introduce the project and its objective, which is to develop a machine learning model for classifying Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

**Dataset Description:**

Provide a summary of the Iris dataset, including the number of instances, features, and classes.
Mention that the dataset consists of measurements of three species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica

**Usage:**

Explain how to use the provided code to train the machine learning model.

**Model Evaluation:**

Describe the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
